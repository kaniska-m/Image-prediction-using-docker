# ML-in-production

In this tutorial we will try to walk together through all the building blocks of a Machine/Deep Learning project in production, i.e. a model that people can actually interact with

As a case study, we’ll be creating a web interface for image recognition using the pretrained model VGG19.

You can check the detailed explanation on the article I wrote in Towards Data Science [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-in-production-keras-flask-docker-and-heroku-933b5f885459)

Without going into too much detail, this project consists of 4 major parts :

## Build model : VGG19

I've used use a pretrained (and effective) Convolutional Neural Network model for image classification : [VGG-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556).

[model.py](./model.py) describe how to load the model, preprocess images in order to be used by that model, and make predictions.

## Create API : Flask

We are also using Flask-Uploads (or Flask-Reuploaded) which allows your application to flexibly and efficiently handle file uploading and serving the uploaded files.

[upload.py](./upload.py) contains the code responsible for running the API. It interacts with the [web page](./templates/upload.html) where the client will upload his image.

## Containerize : Docker

</p>

In short, Docker allows us to create reproducible environments. To do so for the API we've just created, we have to :

**1.** The first thing to do, obviously, is to [download and install Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

**2.** Create the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) in your main directory

**3.** Create a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) (without extension) which contains the instructions for building your Docker image

**4.** In a terminal, run the following command to build the Docker image:
  ```
  # docker build -f Dockerfile -t recog_container:api .
  ```

**5.** Run container in background and print container ID using:
```
# docker run -p 5000:5000 -d recog_container:api
```

Once this is running, you should be able to view your app running in your browser at
```
http://localhost:5000/upload
```

## Deploy : Heroku

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/heroku.png" alt="heroku logo" width="350" height="100">

Thanks to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) we will be able to deploy our application in the Cloud

**1.** Create a new [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you don’t have one. Then download Heroku [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) which makes it easy to create and manage your Heroku apps directly from the terminal.

**2.** Login to your Heroku account using `# heroku login`

**3.** Log in to Container Registry: `# heroku container:login`

**4.** Create a new Heroku app: `# heroku create <app-name>`

**5.** Build the image based on your Dockefile and push it to this particular app in Heroku `# heroku container:push web --app <app-name>`

**6.** You can finally open up your Heroku application through the command `# heroku open --app <app-name>`
